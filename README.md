# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_US_Accidents

This is a countrywide car accident dataset, which covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data are collected from February 2016 to Dec 2020, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Currently, there are about 1.5 million accident records in this dataset.

To perform Exploratory data analysis pandas and seaborn libraries of python were used for data preparation and visualization respectively
